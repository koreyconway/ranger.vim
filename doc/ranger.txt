INTRODUCTION                                                               *ag*

This is a plugin to allow integration with ranger from inside Vim.
It can be used to open files interactively. While the ranger window
is open, the many wonderful features of ranger itself can be used
(including moving and deleting files).

:Ranger                                                            *:Ranger*

    Launch ranger over current buffer
